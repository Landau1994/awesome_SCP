# mPOP

**Minimal ProteOmic sample Preparation**

## Overview

mPOP (Minimal ProteOmic sample Preparation) is a simple, cost-effective method for lysing and processing single cells or small cell populations for proteomics analysis.

## Key Features

- **Freeze-Heat Lysis**: No detergents required
- **Minimal Handling**: Reduces sample loss
- **Tube-Based**: Standard PCR tubes/plates
- **Low Cost**: Standard lab consumables

## Protocol Steps

```
1. Sort cells into 1 µL PBS in PCR plate
2. Freeze at -80°C (≥30 min)
3. Heat at 90°C for 10 min (lysis)
4. Add trypsin (digest)
5. Add TMT reagents (label)
6. Pool and analyze
```

## Advantages

- No specialized equipment
- Low reagent cost
- Compatible with FACS
- Scalable

## Limitations

- Higher reaction volumes than [[nPOP]]
- Some sample loss vs. nanoliter methods
- Manual handling steps

## Key Publications
