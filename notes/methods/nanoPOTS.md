# nanoPOTS

**Nanodroplet Processing in One pot for Trace Samples**

## Overview

nanoPOTS is a chip-based microfluidic platform for processing ultra-low input samples including single cells. Developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).

## Key Features

- **Nanowell Chips**: Microfabricated arrays for sample processing
- **Nanoliter Reactions**: Minimizes surface losses
- **Integrated Workflow**: Lysis, digestion, and optional labeling on-chip

## Chip Versions

### Standard nanoPOTS
- Individual nanowells
- ~10-50 cells per chip

### Nested nanoPOTS (N2)
- 243 cells per chip
- 10-fold improvement in throughput
- Hierarchical nanowell design

## Workflow

```
Single Cells → Dispense to Nanowells →
Lysis Buffer → Trypsin Digestion →
Direct injection or Collection → LC-MS/MS
```

## Performance

- **Sensitivity**: Picogram-level protein input
- **Proteins**: 1,000-3,000 per cell
- **Recovery**: >80% peptide recovery

## Advantages

- Excellent sensitivity
- Reduced sample loss vs tubes
- Reproducible processing
- Suitable for rare cells

## Limitations

- Specialized chip fabrication
- Lower throughput than nPOP
- Higher per-sample cost
